# Collective Intelligence System with Large Language Model Integration

This repository contains a Python implementation of a Collective Intelligence System that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) for enhanced decision-making and natural language processing capabilities. The system leverages the power of collective intelligence and AI to generate informed decisions, insights, and recommendations across various domains.

Ultimately, I envision an interoperable future where multiple agents interact on behalf of differing parties in a seamless fashion, perhaps powered by blockchain technologies with gamified pow mechanisms (or some other powerful technology integrations) to achieve goals in an asynchronous manner, capable of transcending traditional communication methods.

Imagine a personalized conversation swarm that integrates with Brain Computer Interfaces, capable of orchestrating thought patterns into cohesive, actionable insights.

## Features

- Agent-based architecture for distributed decision-making
- Integration with OpenAI's GPT-3 language model for natural language processing
- Swarm intelligence algorithms for collective decision-making
- Customizable context and prompts for domain-specific applications
- Iterative opinion updating based on agent interactions and language model responses
- Consensus opinion generation based on collective intelligence

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenAI API key (sign up at [https://beta.openai.com/signup](https://beta.openai.com/signup))
- `numpy` library
- `openai` library

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/collective-intelligence-system.git
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Set up your OpenAI API key:

- Create a file named `.env` in the project root directory.
- Add the following line to the `.env` file, replacing `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual OpenAI API key:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
```

## Usage

1. Import the necessary classes and initialize the language model and swarm intelligence system:

```python
from language_model import LanguageModel
from swarm_intelligence import SwarmIntelligence

language_model = LanguageModel("text-davinci-002")
swarm = SwarmIntelligence(num_agents, context, language_model)
```

2. Define the context and parameters for the decision-making problem:

```python
context = "A company needs to decide on the best marketing strategy for their new product. The options are:\nA) Social media advertising\nB) Television commercials\nC) Print advertisements\nD) Influencer partnerships"
num_agents = 5
num_iterations = 3
```

3. Run the simulation and obtain the consensus opinion:

```python
consensus = swarm.run_simulation(num_iterations)
print(f"Collective Decision: {consensus}")
```

## Example Applications

The Collective Intelligence System with Large Language Model Integration can be applied to various real-world scenarios, such as:

- Customer Service Chatbots
- Investment and Financial Planning
- Medical Diagnosis and Treatment Planning
- Content Recommendation Systems
- Public Policy and Community Engagement
- Educational Tutoring and Adaptive Learning
- Human Resources and Talent Management
- Supply Chain Optimization and Logistics
